= Staker rewards inspector

== Prerequisites

To run the inspector script, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (at least v14.3.0). We recommend to use
  the https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[Node Version Manager] to get the right
  version with no troubles.

== How to run

1. Make sure you use the right Node.js version:
+
```
nvm use 14.3.0
```
2. Install the NPM dependencies if not done yet:
+
```
npm install
```
3. Run the script along with environment variables:
+
```
ETH_HOSTNAME=<eth-ws-hostname> \
node --experimental-json-modules ./scripts/inspect-staker-rewards.js \
<interval-start-unix-timestamp> <interval-end-unix-timestamp>
```
+
You can also use several auxiliary environment variables:

- `DEBUG=on` to enable debug logs
- `CACHE_REFRESH=off` to disable the cache refresh process
